/**
 * Modern developer landing page with high craft inspired by interfaces.dev:
 * - Wide 1336px responsive container with comfortable whitespace
 * - Animate UI components: spring CopyButton, CountingNumber, spring gliding tabs
 * - Strict design system compliance: smallest text is text-xs, zero custom -[] values
 * - Decoupled modular sections (only client components that need it are lazy loaded)
 * - Zero barrel overhead with explicit package imports
