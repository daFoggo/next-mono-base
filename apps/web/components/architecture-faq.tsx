    question: "How do I switch between Neon Auth, Supabase, Keycloak, and FastAPI OAuth2?",
    answer:
      "All four providers are normalized behind the unified AuthProvider interface in @workspace/auth. Set AUTH_PROVIDER in apps/dashboard/.env.local (neon-auth, supabase, keycloak, or fastapi-oauth). Server actions, proxy session refreshes, and getSession() calls remain 100% identical without changing any application code.",
  },
  {
    id: "cache-components",
    question: "How does Next.js 16 Cache Components and Partial Prerendering (PPR) work?",
    answer:
      "apps/dashboard has cacheComponents and partialPrefetching enabled in next.config.ts. Dynamic runtime APIs (cookies(), headers(), searchParams) are isolated inside <Suspense> boundaries, allowing layouts and static shells to prerender instantly while data fetching uses 'use cache' and cacheLife directives for per-user and shared caching.",
  },
  {
    id: "data-access-layer",
    question: "What is the Data Access Layer (DAL) and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "The DAL resides in features/*/queries.ts and lib/auth.ts. It guarantees strict server-only boundaries so that database credentials, JWT secrets, and Keycloak client secrets never leak into client bundles. Every mutation goes through validated Server Actions with Zod schemas.",
  },
  {
    id: "pruning-providers",
    question: "Can I use only one provider and prune the others if I don't need them?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Each provider is completely isolated in packages/auth/src/{neon-auth,supabase,keycloak,fastapi-oauth}/. If your team only uses Keycloak, Supabase, or FastAPI OAuth2, the other submodules remain inactive unless configured in your environment.",
  },
  {
    id: "ai-workflows",
    question: "How is this starter base optimized for Claude AI and coding agents?",
    answer:
      "The repository contains strict AGENTS.md rules, exhaustive docs/ architecture guides, and Antigravity/Claude AI skill definitions. AI agents automatically read these rules to generate code that adheres to monorepo boundaries, zero-shadow design system tokens, and strict type safety without hallucination.",
  },
  {
    id: "security-audit",
    question: "How is security verified and audited in this architecture?",
    answer:
      "The codebase is audited using a formal security audit skill with deterministic 10-unit coverage ledgers and parallel hunter agents. Defenses include token-bound tenant isolation, fail-fast production secret validation, least-privilege DAL permissions, PostgreSQL search_path pinning, live DB role checks in RPCs, and strict ESLint client/server boundaries.",
